            <p id= "bio-text">Jee Hyun Lee explores her fashion practices and designs through the process of transforming the intangible beauty found in mundane everyday life into a tangible human structure, creating meaning out of the transient. Her clothing serves as a memento of that beauty which is captured in its fleeting moments and transposed into garments that complement the individual. Structural designs that signal a mark of human creation and craft are weaved with feminine details, allusion to the body form. Through this duality, Jee Hyun Lee pursues contemporary feminine chic bridging the gap between traditional notions of the body and femininity with contemporary and architectural forms.
